# Reservation System

A reservation system for a local plumber. It should provide time slots and when an appointment is booked, it should tell the plumber what parts would be required for that specific repair.
It should also have a secondary view so the plumber can see what parts are needed for that specific day. It should also keep track of the parts on hand, and if a part is missing or out of stock, we should notify them so they can pick it up from the wholesale store.

## Project Overview
 For our project, we decided to go with the name Broken Pipe Plumbing as a reservation system for a local plumber. It provides services offered, appointment time slots for users to make appointments. The admin dashboard provides current day appointments with parts needed for that day.  It also displays low in stock inventory. In case the admin needs to pick up those low stock parts from the store.  The admin will also be able to view past, present, and future appointments.

We started with the user flow and wrote down what api’s we need with the request and response in FigJam. We then discussed how our data would need to be stored

We used excalidraw to create our wireframes

We've documented our APIs using Swagger. 

Our tech stack is Next. js  and Java  and we are deploying the backend using Render in a container and our frontend to Vercel.

Our frontend team consists of Prasanna, George, Jesus and the backend team is Chris, and Jesus
