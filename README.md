# Reservation System

A reservation system for a local plumber. It should provide time slots and when an appointment is booked, it should tell the plumber what parts would be required for that specific repair.
It should also have a secondary view so the plumber can see what parts are needed for that specific day. It should also keep track of the parts on hand, and if a part is missing or out of stock, we should notify them so they can pick it up from the wholesale store.
